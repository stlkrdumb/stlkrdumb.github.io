# Maye: Lending Protocol w/ Onchain Private Credit

Maye is a premium, privacy-preserving consumer lending interface deployed on the **Base Sepolia Testnet**. By integrating cryptographically signed credentials verified on-chain, Maye allows borrowers to unlock dynamic, under-collateralized loans. 

Instead of absolute over-collateralization typical in standard DeFi (fixed 150%), Maye enables borrowers to lower their required Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio down to **67%** and interest rates down to **7.4%** by proving their real-world creditworthiness privately.

## 📐 Architecture & Mechanics

Maye integrates on-chain capital allocation with cryptographic attestations via a dual-token under-collateralized pool:

    LP -->|Disburse USDC Loan| B
    
    B -->|Repay USDC Debt| LP
    LP -->|Release RLO Collateral| B
```

### Protocol Calculations:
* **Base Collateral Ratio:** 150% (Standard DeFi).
* **Discount System:**
  * **Credit Score Attestation:** -25% Collateral | -1.8% Interest APR
  * **Banking Asset Verification:** -20% Collateral | -1.2% Interest APR
  * **KYC / Legal Identity Check:** -15% Collateral | -0.8% Interest APR
  * **On-Chain Repayment History:** -10% Collateral | -0.6% Interest APR
  * **Default Reporting Consent:** -8% Collateral | -0.4% Interest APR
  * *Combo Bonus (5/5 verified):* -5% Collateral | -0.3% Interest APR
* **Max Discounted Collateral Ratio:** 67% (Under-collateralized borrowing).
* **Min Interest Rate:** 7.4% APR (Base rate is 12.5% APR).

## ⚡ Getting Started & Local Installation

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js**: `v20` or higher
* **Git**: Installed
* **Foundry** (Optional, for smart contract development): Install via `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash` followed by `foundryup`

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the frontend dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stlkrdumb/maye.git
cd maye
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Ensure the environment variables are set correctly:
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`: RPC URL for Base Sepolia (or your local node).
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID`: `84532` (Base Sepolia).
* `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`: Deployer wallet private key (for deploying/funding scripts).

### 3. Run Local Dev Server
Start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the web application.

### 4. Smart Contract Development & Testing (Foundry)
To build and test the Solidity contracts locally:
```bash
# Compile contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test -vv
```

## 📖 Step-by-Step User Tutorial

To fully experience the borrow, lend, and credit verification system on the Base Sepolia Testnet, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Connect Wallet & Get Faucets
1. Open the Maye application and click **Connect Wallet** in the top navigation.
2. In the **Lend** page or **Apply** page checkout, use the integrated faucets to mint:
   * **Test USDC**: Claims mock USDC to deposit or repay loans.
   * **Mock RLO**: Claims mock RLO tokens to lock as borrowing collateral.

### Step 2: Verify Credentials (Build Your Trust Profile)
1. Go to the **Apply** section from the homepage or navigation.
2. Under **Step 1: Trust & Identity Check**, click **Verify** on the available credentials:
   * Credit Score Bureau Attestation (Bureau API validation)
   * Banking Asset Verification (Open-banking payload verification)
   * KYC / Legal Identity Check (Government ID cryptographic attestation)
   * On-Chain Repayment History (Base Sepolia historical trace scan)
   * Default Reporting Consent (Cryptographic Consent Attestation)
3. Notice how each verified credential dynamically reduces your **Required LTV Ratio** (from 150% down to 67%) and **Active Borrow APR** (from 12.5% down to 7.4%).

### Step 3: Configure Borrowing Terms & Borrow USDC
1. Click **Configure Borrowing Terms**.
2. Adjust the sliders to set your desired **USDC Borrow Amount** and **Loan Duration (Days)**.
3. Review the **Capital Saved** card, which shows how much collateral you are saving compared to standard over-collateralized DeFi protocols.
4. Click **Proceed to Checkout**.
5. Click **Approve RLO** to authorize the contract, then click **Confirm & Borrow**. Once mined, the USDC will be in your wallet.

### Step 4: Monitor and Repay on the Dashboard
1. Open the **Dashboard** page.
2. View your **Portfolio Health** factor percentage:
   * **Green ($\ge 115\%$):** Safely collateralized.
   * **Yellow ($100\% - 115\%$):** Warnings boundary, close to liquidation.
   * **Red ($< 100\%$):** Critical/liquidable.
3. Review your **Active Borrow Positions** listing.
4. To close a loan and release your locked RLO, click **Repay Debt** on the loan card. You will approve USDC spending and pay off the outstanding balance (accrued principal + interest).

### Step 5: Lend and Earn APY
1. Navigate to the **Lend** page.
2. Enter an amount of USDC and click **Deposit**.
3. Your deposits supply liquidity for active borrowers and earn a variable APY based on utilization.
4. Withdraw your assets at any time subject to pool liquidity.
